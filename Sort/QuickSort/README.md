# QuickSort

The solution 'Sort-Quick' is fast (not always, but in many cases) sort algorithm for C language. I made two type, Non-Recursive && Recursive.

Since my favorite word is Emperor, so i named it E(emperor) q(quick) sort. Also each type has different file name, so they can be easily distinguished.
